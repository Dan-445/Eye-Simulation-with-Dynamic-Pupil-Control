# Eye-Simulation-with-Dynamic-Pupil-Control
This project simulates an eye with a dynamic pupil, iris, and sclera. The pupil size can change based on ambient light using a light sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi. The simulation also allows you to change the colors of the eye (sclera, iris, pupil) via a simple GUI.
